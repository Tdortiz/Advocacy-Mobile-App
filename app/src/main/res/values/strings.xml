        Climate change and habitat destruction is driving tens of thousands of species of plants and animals to the brink of extinction.

        For almost 40 years, the Endangered Species Act (ESA) has been a vital part of the fight to save wild places and wild animals, but under the new anti-environment leadership in the U.S. Senate and House of Representatives, we have seen repeated attempts to attack the ESA and other critical wildlife protections.

        Whether it has been attacks on protections for specific species like wolves, sea otters, salmon and sage grouse; attempting to subvert funding for undermining anti-poaching efforts that are working to keep rhinos and elephants from extinction, the new Congress is determined to destroy the critical protections that wildlife depend on.

        But we've seen over and over that calling for protections for endagered species WORKS. Make sure Congress hears us loud and clear: Oppose attacks on wildlife!"
