# Advocacy-Mobile-App
As an advocacy organization, I employ individuals to canvass door to door or on the street to raise awareness, solicit donations, and add to my house file.  I need a streamlined interface where my canvassers can quickly create new constituents and document the interaction in a way that we can aggregate or target these constituents in the future.
