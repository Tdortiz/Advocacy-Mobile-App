# Door To More
4th place finalist at Blackbaud's Off The Grid - Summer 2016

Door To More was created in 24 hours to benefit advocacy organizations that would employ individuals to canvass door to door or on the street to raise awareness, solicit donations, and add to in-house files. The purpose of the app is to create a streamlined interface where canvassers can quickly create new constituents and document the interaction in a way that advocacy organizations can aggregate or target these constituents in the future.
